# Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

File structure for components:
1. Exported component
2. Subcomponents
3. Helper functions
4. Static content
5. Types

Always follow these patterns when modifying or creating new code.
