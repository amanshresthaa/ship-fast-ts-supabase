# Quiz Component Refactoring Summary

## Project Structure
We've successfully refactored the quiz components to follow a more maintainable controller-based architecture.

### Core Abstractions (Sprint 1)
- Created `AnswerValidator` abstract class with concrete implementations for each question type
- Implemented `useAutoValidation` hook to standardize auto-validation behavior
- Developed `QuestionController` base class and type-specific subclasses
- Created `QuestionControllerFactory` for centralized controller instantiation
- Refactored `SingleSelectionComponent` to use the controller pattern

### Controllers for All Types (Sprint 2)
- Implemented `MultiChoiceController` and validator
- Implemented `DropdownSelectionController` and validator
- Implemented `DragAndDropController` and validator
- Added unit tests for all controllers

### Component Refactoring (Sprint 3)
- Refactored `MultiChoiceComponent` to use controller + hook
- Refactored `DropdownSelectionComponent` to use controller + hook
- Refactored `DragAndDropQuestionComponent` to use controller + hook
  - Improved drag-and-drop interaction with controller-based state management
  - Enhanced feedback visualization using controller validation
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for component behavior
- Updated `QuestionTypeRenderer` to use controller factory

## Benefits of the Refactoring
1. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Presentation logic in components
   - Business logic in controllers
   - Validation logic in validators

2. **Standardized Auto-Validation**:
   - Consistent validation behavior across all question types
   - Centralized validation logic reduces code duplication

3. **Easier Maintenance and Testing**:
   - Controllers and validators can be tested independently
   - Components are simpler with less internal state management
   - New question types can follow the established pattern

4. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Generic typing for controllers and validators
   - Explicit interfaces for all components

## Completed Refactoring
All planned component refactoring has been completed successfully. Each question type component now follows the controller pattern:

1. `SingleSelectionComponent` → `SingleSelectionController` + `SingleSelectionValidator`
2. `MultiChoiceComponent` → `MultiChoiceController` + `MultiChoiceValidator` 
3. `DropdownSelectionComponent` → `DropdownSelectionController` + `DropdownSelectionValidator`
4. `DragAndDropQuestionComponent` → `DragAndDropController` + `DragAndDropValidator`

## Next Steps
1. Extract shared UI components like `OptionCard` and `SubmitBanner`
2. Add end-to-end tests to verify behavior
3. Expand documentation for the new architecture
4. Compare bundle size before and after refactoring
