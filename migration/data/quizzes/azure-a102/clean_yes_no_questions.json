      "question": "You create a web app named app1 that runs on an Azure virtual machine named vm1. Vm1 is on an Azure virtual network named vnet1. You plan to create a new Azure Cognitive Search service named service1. You need to ensure that app1 can connect directly to service1 without routing traffic over the public internet. Solution: You deploy service1 and a public endpoint, and you configure an IP firewall rule. Does this meet the goal?",
      "points": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "no",
      "feedback": {
        "correct": "Correct! Instead deploy service1 and a private (not public) endpoint to a new virtual network, and you configure Azure Private Link.",
        "incorrect": "Incorrect! Deploying a public endpoint means traffic potentially traverses the public internet. An IP firewall restricts access *to* the public endpoint but doesn't create a private connection path. A private endpoint is needed."

You discover that some search query requests to the Cognitive Search service are being throttled. You need to reduce the likelihood that search query requests are throttled. Solution: You migrate to a Cognitive Search service that uses a higher tier. Does this meet the goal?",
      "points": 1,
      "correctAnswer": "yes",
      "feedback": {
        "correct": "Correct! Migrating to a higher tier typically provides more resources (Query Processing Units, storage, potentially higher limits on replicas/partitions), which can alleviate throttling caused by insufficient capacity.",

        "correct": "Correct! The Smart Labeler suggests tags for *existing* untagged images based on the *current* model. To incorporate *new species*, you must add the images, manually label them with the new species names (create new tags), and then *retrain* the model to learn these new classes. Smart Labeler alone doesn't add new classes or retrain.",

NSGs control traffic flow *to/from* resources within a VNet or subnet, but they don't prevent traffic destined for a public endpoint from leaving the VNet to reach the public internet.

CMK encryption enhances security by giving you control over the encryption keys for data at rest, but it does not increase the query processing capacity of the search service. It might even introduce a slight performance overhead. Throttling is addressed by scaling resources (replicas, partitions, tier).",
